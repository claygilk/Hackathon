1. The objective of Scrobble is to spell as many words as you can. Each letter tile has a point value assigned to it, like in Scrabble. The more words you spell, the more points you earn.

2. To spell a word, click-and-drag a letter tile from your hand to a square on the board. You can only place a tile on an empty square that is vertically or horizontally adjacent to an already placed letter tile. When you start the game, 5 random letter tiles will be placed on the board to get you started.

3. There are some restrictions with spelling words: You can only spell words from left-to-right, or top-to-bottom. The minimum length for a word is 3 letters.

4. If you get stuck, and can't spell anymore words you can click the "Get New Hand" button, to return your tiles to the deck and draw 10 more random tiles. Drawing a new hand consume a life, and you only get 3 lives per game. When you run out of lives you can no longer refresh you hand.

5. When you think you can no longer spell anymore words, press the "Give Up" button. This will end the game and prompt you to enter your initals for a chance to make it onto the leaderboards.
